hactac: rpg-ish tabletop game for dead tree and digital tables alike



Build the books
---------------

Simply run pdflatex on the book.tex for the main book.
> pdflatex book.tex
or similar if you prefer alternative output. All latex environments I've tried have worked so far.

The adventures are built individually. Each adventure has one main .tex file named after the adventure, so simply run pdflatex on that file. E.g:
> pdflatex "00 Dungeon of Testing.tex"

If you're new to latex, please run the first local build of a project thrice. Either see it as the magic of the layout demons, or learn why: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/53235 (latex, bibtex, latex, latex)



General
-------

Checkout "Adventures in Kingsland" for a general intro orientation.

Start with the simple basic rules, play through "Dungeon of Testing" with each player individually to get yourself and your players familiar with the system as they create their characters. Then play "Return of Uchly Namen" with the full party.

As you get used to the system, add and delete from the more complex rules, skills, etc until you find a good trade off between speed and complexity, suitable to your specific gaming group.



Current state
-------------

It is well tested, hundreds of hours since 2008. There are several campaigns ready with multiple adventures each. Works well for both regular table top play and for virtual table top software. The GM and players can choose the level of complexity they are comfortable with.

This is my personal notes package, not draft quality material intended for publication. There is still a lot of stuff which is in progress of being updated, with inconsistencies, notes, TODOs etc. I'm updating this package whenever I have the time and inclination.

It is however quite complete. We have been using it for many years. I'll be adding the rest of the campaigns and adventures as I get the time to clean them up somewhat.

Anything you want to change or add? Contact me! Or even better: go to github https://github.com/netjiro/hactac and check out the source. Make your changes and send me a pull request. Even small stuff like spelling, grammar, clarifications, etc are appreciated. If enough people have interest in it I might dig out some time to improve the quality to something closer to a publication draft.

Repository layout
-----------------

Not dumping all my image material (tokens, battle maps, handouts, etc) together with the core game here. I don't have the copyright. I'll see what I can do later on. But for now, it's mainly text, some maps, the automation scripts for the maptool virtual tabletop software, etc. I have some maps and token images I've made myself, so I'll add them when I get the time if someone is interested.

My working directory layout looks like this:
hactac
    adventures       << the original adventure source files
    dl               << downloads, images and other stuff not yet in use
    icons & avatars  << for forums etc
    live             << save files, notes, etc for current adventures
    maps             << maptool: maps for quick access
    maptool          << maptool: misc maptool settings and files, and link tree
    markers          << maptool: images for marking map spots and such
    misc             <<
    objects          << maptool: image objects
    old              <<
    rules            << the rule book
    snapshots        << snapshots of rules and adventure pdfs and historical
    software         << snapshots of maptool, mumble clients, jarnal, etc
    states           << maptool: character token state marker images
    templates        << maptool: map effect template marker images
    tex              << latex include settings
    tmp              <<
    tokens           << maptool: token images
    tokpic           << maptool: maptool specific token files

Most of the file space is binary: images and campaign files, and I don't generally put them under version control.



The history
-----------

The hactac rules and world setting have evolved sporadically since early 2008. I was working a postdoc contract at Utrecht University and wanted to stay in contact with friends Up North in Scandinavia for some occasional gaming. Due to family and work requirements for most of us it was also evident from earlier on that we needed a new arrangement to keep gaming at a reasonable frequency. The proper get together rpg games are tricky to schedule when people have kids and live spread out over different countries.

So that's why I wrote this stuff, which together with maptool and mumble works quite well for playing quick, simple, fun adventures and campaigns. It is not meant to get even close to the real gather-together-and-eat-homebrew-guck role playing. Instead it's just fun sporadic gaming, a bit silly, but with significant tactical depth.

I inject these adventures to fill the void found in between sessions of our long running role playing campaigns and the occasional one shot board game days.
We play this for a couple of hours in the evenings every now and then after people have put their kids to sleep. Periodically, during campaigns, it's 2-3h on a fixed weekday evening.

Back in the day we briefly had a Warhammer Quest "campaign" running. It was fun, but quickly deteriorated and died due to the horribly poor balance. We also played some Descent occasionally, but that requires gathering for a full day, and I usually prefer campaigns instead of one shot adventures.

Many years ago, in my pre-teens, I experimented with writing a very simple rule set and world setting, to use for a "silly campaign" when we couldn't get all the people gathered for my regular rpg campaign. That turned out quite well. It was fun despite the extreme simplicity of both the rules and the world. That was my base idea when I started working on this package, but I wanted to see how much tactical depth we could get from simple rules.

I've split the rules into the very basic fundamentals, and the rest. Just choose what to include to the point where it is a good fit for your group. Find your own trade off between speed and complexity. The basic stuff is very fast and straight forward, while the full set is more suitable for a script assisted virtual tabletop like maptool, etc.

At the base it's simple enough for young kids to understand. At full complexity it requires quite a bit more since I have tuned it for my regular players who are mostly engineers and scientists.

Fast gaming is crucial for us since we only have a couple of hours each session. The battles must be tactically interesting and the role playing rewarding. Coordination, timing, positioning, complementary skills and battle maneuvers are very important. Just charging in for dps dice rally doesn't cut it. This brings the tactical depth. The role playing aspects are written for comedy. In the end it is supposed to be fun, clichÃ©, and more than a bit silly most of the time.
