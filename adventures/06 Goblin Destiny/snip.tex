Lundqvist core march in, follow the funnel and go into heavy melee with the goblin defensive plug gaggle. The Heroes' funnelling and surround tactics work reasonably well for a little while but Lundqvist are too focused and coordinated for the goblins to be able to put any main melee line against them and survive. And the stop plug is mostly empty numbers, goblin fighters and warriors.

Captain lundqvist and his heavy core, total 10 strong, slam into the goblin defence line and start obliterating it at scary speed and with determined skill.


Lundqvist main line marches straight into the goblin defense plug and start decimating it with fast synchronised attacks. Several goblins fall quickly before the side attack group can spring into action. The outside force can't enter since the Lundqvist rear guard is still formed up at the cave entrance.
The sneaky side attack group engage but is nowhere near stong enough to push the main heavy Lundqvist core into disarray. The Heroes quickly loose another skilled goblin champion and one of the strongest melee Heroes hang onto life at negative hp. Dogoban have thrown his feedback football causing serious problems for the goblin spellslinger in the side attack group.

But at least the core Lundqvist group is beset and their advance has ground to a stop. A couple of rounds later Lundqvist shout for his rear force to enter the cave.
