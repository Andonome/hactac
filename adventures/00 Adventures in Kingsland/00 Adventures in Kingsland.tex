\section*{Adventures in Kingsland}
\markboth{Kingsland}{Kingsland}

\noindent
Play online with your bestest buddies, a couple of hours on weekday evenings when the kids are asleep, or from the hotel room, easy to schedule, built for vtt and voice.
Fast and tactically challenging tabletop battles and fantasy themed mini war games, set in clich√© role playing campaigns and one shot adventures. 
Build the optimal monster-murder squad, tinker with skills, weapons, magic, etc, for that special clever edge.

\

\emph{Or}

\

\noindent
Play with the kids on the dining room table, or across half the house. Use their favourite toys as Hero figs and the dreaded \textsc{lego} men as the countless minions of Lord Grapefruit.
Simple, quick, fun role playing adventures full of wonder, exploration, puzzles, riddles, and perhaps some tricksy fights if the GM is so inclined. 
Huge width of freedom in character creation with a skill based, classless, rule set where you can choose the complexity level you want to find the sweet spot between fast simple fun and challenging depth and complexity.

\

\emph{You choose}

\

\noindent
The rule set is highly flexible. The basics is simple enough for very young kids. The full complete rule set leaves enough room for a clever scientist to tinker and get lost in.

%\

\

\noindent
Explicitly designed for fast online play. Easy to schedule for busy people. Small and simple basic rule set with inherent tactical depth and very quick play. Lots of optional addons for extra depth and complexity so you can choose your own game style.

This is not like D\&D, d20, Cypher, Warhammer, WoD/Storyteller, Fate, Savage Worlds, et al. It is faster and with more tactical depth. Trading real world realism for speed and storytelling, coolness and mighty heroics. Optimised for fast online play. The game is classless, skill based, and the skills directly change the rules of the game. It plays more like Space Hulk style fighting wrapped in fantasy adventure campaigns.

\item[Schedulable:] A couple of hours on weekday evenings is enough. Play online with vtt and voice. Simple, quick, no fuss. 
\textbf{\textit{Just Get Gaming!}} 

The game is explicitly designed to play online, so busy people can play. We have had hundreds of sessions since 2008, even when people have been spread out over different countries, had demanding careers, lots of travel, young kids, etc.


\item[Kids:] Starts simple enough for 5yo kids, and scales up through university. Sparkly Pony, Lightning McQueen, and the old Rubber Troll make excellent Heroes as they go explore the dark depths below the dining room table.

Or play with pen and paper, meeples or minis, battle maps or improvised terrain. You don't need much to start, and you already have it at home.


\item[Hundreds of hours of adventures:] Built and tested over many years. Loads of adventures and several campaign arcs present highly varied experiences, stories, and challenges, all across Kingsland. 


\item[Share and meet new gamers:] Upload and share your adventures with the greater community. Find new friends, steal cool ideas, adventures, characters, maps, figs, etc, discuss that \emph{awful} rule I just pushed, and how much better it would be \emph{this other way}.

\

\item[Fast:] Lots of quick rounds. Attack, retreat, sneak around behind, flank, make a stand until the sorcerer has finished his summoning, then disengage and escape through the secret tunnel. All in a fluid and varied battle in the dungeons of the Antorg Slavers.

Supports 50+ Heroes and Monsters on the map in full glorious slaughter, but keep it below 20 and no one will get bored.

\section*{Gold and Glory await the Brave Heroes}

\noindent
For the very young we have adventures like \texttt{Bitter Candy} where Lord Grapefruit is threatening to make all the sweets in the land taste like coffee. Play with your kids' favourite toys across half the house, or on a table using maps and meeples. Use grapes as the Villain's minions and have your kids eat their kills.

We also have the \texttt{Ominous Crown} example for slightly older children, or turn it into a small mini campaign for your brave new adult players. I hear wine and cheese is good when you set out to rescue the Blacksmith's daughter.

New players should run their first new Hero through the \texttt{Dungeon of Testing}, where they will learn the basics in a non lethal environment.

\

\noindent
For a longer new player campaign we have \texttt{Return of Uchly Namen} where the newbies travel to Sleepy Cove chasing a "Heroes Wanted" ad. Goblins, bandits, monsters, from deep mine shafts to high towers. The Heroes will travel the land and encounter a varied range of opposition, suitable to introduce the game in bite sized pieces.

When they have solved the mystery, as experienced almost-heroes, they can take on the \texttt{Dark Klan}, explore the \texttt{Deep Cave}, and go \texttt{Rescue Nurensachs}, in a mid range campaign arc.

\

\noindent
\texttt{Overlord Orvar} is an up and coming Dark Lord. He's set up shop close to Kleinshof and is preparing for his campaign of Death, Destruction, and Domination. Better stop him before it starts.

Then there is the ashen greyness spreading in the Eastern Mountains. \texttt{Edwin the Chromophobe} has awoken from his slumber and is slowly poisoning the world, his influence spreading from his Dread Tomb. The Heroes must delve into the dark depths to solve the hiccup.

\

\noindent
At some point the Heroes should perhaps get Certified as Heroes of the Land? \texttt{Ottokar's Test Dungeon} provide those services for a bag of silver. Official Hero Certification is a racket, for sure, but many clueless middle management gnomes insist that they will only bring on Officially Certified Heroes for the task at hand.

Experienced Heroes can perhaps be hired for a dangerous mission to \texttt{Destroy the Altar} deep in the goblin warrens. This is not for the faint of heart nor weak of arm. And if they survive that they will be offered to \texttt{Turn off the Light}. How many Heroes does it take to unscrew a light bulb? How many will die in the process?

\

\noindent
Different kinds of challenges pop up in the \texttt{Goblin Destiny} campaign. We follow the GamGang bandits from when they have just moved in to when they finally fulfil their Destiny. Intended for experienced players, but starts with noob goblin Heroes.

\section*{Built for online gaming}

The rule set and campaign setting was explicitly built for online gaming. Most people want to play more than they can. This is a way to make it happen.


\subsection*{A Virtual TableTop}

There are many choices available. Choose which one you and your players feel comfortable with. You don't need much support for special features. The basics are available in all common tools. Import maps from images. Import Hero and Monster tokens from images. Move tokens around on the map. All tools allow all players to access their Heroes on the map and move them around. The GM moves the monsters and NPCs. 

Some tools have support for fog of war for exploration and sight, vision blocking for walls and objects, individual vision for each Hero, dynamic lighting and darkness, etc. But that's not necessary to play and have fun. You don't get that in a regular tabletop game, so you don't strictly need it.\\
\emph{But it can be a lot of fun to have.} And it allows for some interesting exploration and tactical gameplay. 

Scripting is available in some tools. It allows to build automation for common tasks and offload the old noggin from having to keep track of numbers and details.

\

We've used maptool through the years with good success. It has all the useful bells and whistles, and is open source and self hosted to boot. The scripting language is horrible, but I've managed to cobble together automation with over 90\% coverage of the common tasks.


\subsection*{Voice chat}

So many options, but most of them suck donkey balls. Go with what you already like, but \emph{Don't} use skype, webex, or other commercial conferencing tools. They are absolutely horrible.

Mumble is the best option we've found thus far. Great sound quality, best latency and jitter, and some other useful options. Also open source and self hosted. Discord is simpler but has worse latency and quality. The old guard: teamspeak, ventrilo, etc probably still work. Hangouts, et al. are generally worse and less reliable.

\

What the hell, just go with mumble, and if you can't be bothered to set it up, then check out discord.


\subsection*{Sketching} Fun, and sometimes useful, to have a shared sketch table. Jarnal works but is very limited. There are a ton of tools on the web, with good and bad.

\section*{Physical TableTop gaming}

The rule set is very flexible and easy to adapt to \emph{your} player group. Find a good trade off between speed and complexity. Start with the very small and basic rule set, then add interesting rules, skills, details, etc until you feel it's getting slow. Pick and choose as you go. Get rid of things you don't like and test new stuff that you find interesting. The game is exceptionally modular and very easy to tweak. There is an enormous space of interesting \emph{interactions} between all the optional parts, but very few \emph{interdependencies}, meaning you rarely need A to get B working.


\subsection*{Young Kids} 

It really is super easy in the simplest basic version, without lots of extras. We've had successful games with a 5yo girls who have never played an adventure game, rpg, or tabletop before. Older kids have had no problem getting into the game. \emph{Keep it fun} and don't overload them.

Their small toys work perfectly well as Hero mini figs. You don't need a map grid, just use paper strips or strings to measure out movement and ranges. Use small pretty pearls and trinkets as hp and mana counters, etc. Be open minded and involve the kids, find something that works, and have fun. Adventure awaits, and it doesn't have to be complicated or involved in the beginning.

If they can count to 10, add and subtract a bit, they can play the game.


\subsection*{Battle maps, minis, terrain}

But even if quick sketches on a paper and some improvised tokens is enough to make the game work, it really looks cool with well built terrain, trees, houses, cavern floor, painted minis, and distinct counters.

The game is agnostic. Just use what you can scrounge up. A 40k Genestealer serves perfectly well for a ClawRunner, and that old obscure lead figurine is a great MonsterX.

Be as puritanical as you wish. Excellent imagery awaits and the players will love it, but only if you want to.


\subsection*{Pen and paper, markers, tokens, counters}

A piece of paper with character and notes together with some tokens and counters is enough to play full complexity, even if it will be a bit faster with vtt script automation.

\section*{Kingsland}

The rules are setting agnostic and can be applied to most game worlds, from fantasy to contemporary to scifi. But the default setting is Kingsland, a traditional mid fantasy world. And especially a tiny little spot of Kingsland, the small harbour town of Sleepy Cove and a few villages, forests, hills and mountains around it.

All the released adventures take place in this tiny region. The Heroes and general population don't know much more than their immediate surroundings. Most have never travelled further than the neighbouring village, and have only heard stories and rumours of the greater Kingsland and whatever domains exist beyond.

The practical world is small and dense. It takes just a day or two between villages, and there are only a few of them. Two barons divide the land between them. This little lump of civilisation lives in general peace and quiet. As the campaigns and adventures play out the region will change. Baron Conq will topple Baron Pawa with his dastardly scheming. The SouthWood goblin bandits will be routed and the woods will be safer for a while, until GamGang moves in to claim the empty goblin cave. Overlord Orvar will leave a piece of well constructed prime dungeon real estate empty when he's killed. Who or what will move in to claim it?

Continue placing adventures in the region and keep fleshing out the villages, add npcs and stories. Make the region come alive and anchor it in your players' mind. This is a good way to make it feel real. Exploration, experience, memories, stories.
