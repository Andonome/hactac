str requirements are not directly connected with heaviness or range/span to enable higher dimensionality / variability in the tactical play.

heaviness:         against opponents heaviness
any diff outside +/-(span) goes against difficulty


stamina cost:    norm sqrt(heaviness)
attack:   full stamina cost
defense:  half stamina cost



? is it worth connecting with base stats, or better to keep it completely seperate ?
weapon weight span is dependent on str      ?
weapon range span is dependent on dex       ?
weapon stamina cost is dependent on con     ?
