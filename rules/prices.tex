\section*{Currency}
%------------------
money: 1 gold = 10 silver = 100 copper\\
Some folk use beads, feathers, shells, teeth, etc. But since those critters often haggle and negotiate with their fists, the trade procedures and "agreed upon" price is ... fluctuating?

\section*{Listed and actual prices}
%----------------------------------
List prices are supposed to be approximate averages of actual market prices. Some places are cheaper, others more expensive.

Old used equipment can be found at greatly reduced prices, 50\% or even 25\% of original cost, but usually have lower stats and odd quirks and problems. How about a Lochaber that has a 1 in 10 chance of loosing it's head, which takes 1d3 rounds to re-fit? Or how about an armour that only absorbs on a roll of 1-7, or one in which you cannot make left turns or defend against the left flank? A crossbow that jams on 9-10, and which takes 1r to clear? Or how about a lantern that goes out randomly after 10+1d10 turns unless you stop and shake it carefully, just right, for 1r as a precaution?


\section*{Quality of items}
%--------------------------
The list prices and equipment stats are for regular equipment. Well made equipment has better stats perhaps, or weighs 10-30\% less, but costs 3-5 times more than regular quality. Master craftsman quality costs 5-10 times more than regular quality, and at least a few of gold. They cost a lot but has better stats, maybe a point or two extra damage or a tohit bonus, and weighs less and/or has 30-50\% better absorption, lower str or dex requirements, etc.

%A master craftsman sword can have a +1 to damage, or +1 bonus to the weapon skill, or +5 higher abs or 33\% lower weight. Or some such bonus or beneficial property.

Not all equipment or properties can be boosted like this. An abs 2 leather armour will cost much more than 5 gold (10x leather armour base price), if it is even possible to make, and would probably require the hide from some very exotic and dangerous monster.

Special equipment can generally be found in larger towns and cities.
The prices vary quite a bit, half or double price is nothing strange.

Speciality bolts and arrows tend to be single use, or possibly a few times.
They easily break or get damaged to the point where their extra properties
are lost to damage. At which point they are useless or work as regular arrows
with some negative mods: mod-1 / dam-1 / pen-1

Master crafted weapons can be purchased as "special" equipment, and usually cost 5x-10x the list value of the weapon plus a few gold as baseline cost to make even staffs and short swords expensive when master crafted. These weapons usually have 30-50\% improved abs, and perhaps a mod+1 to attack and/or parry or dam+1 properties as well. Master crafted weapon should not cost less than 5g.

A master craftsman can also make customised weapons. E.g: an axe or a sword that is suited specifically for the properties of the customer, with the damage and strength requirements matched perfectly. Custom items usually cost 3-5x of base value plus an extra gold or two. A custom weapon should not cost less than 3g.

Then it's possible to make a custom master crafted weapon, combining custom requirements with master crafted bonuses, but at even higher prices, 10g minimum.

It probably takes a week for a master craftsman to make high quality or custom weapon, provided he has enough of the high quality materials available. Otherwise there are always heroes around who can take it upon themselves to go out and find that rare lump of sky iron, or barrel of basilisk blood.

\

Magical potions and single use or multi use items are mostly custom made special or exotic equipment. A few magical potions and items are made in quantity and thus much cheaper, like Quaff! But mostly it's just a few custom items, expensive, time consuming

The cost of a custom made magical potion can be estimated to:\\
\verb|1 + (0.25 * (mana+1) * scf * psy) gold| \\
E.g: a potion of firestorm with 3 mana would cost approximately:\\
\verb|1 + (0.25 * (3+1) * 0.33 * 8 ) = 3.6 gold|

The cost of a custom made magical single use or multi use magical item can be estimated to: \\
\verb|single use:  3 + (0.25 * (mana+2) * scf * psy) gold| \\
\verb|multi use : 5 + uses * (0.25 * (mana+2) * scf * psy) gold| \\
E.g: a single use wand and one with 4 charges of 3 mana shock bolts would cost approximately: \\
\verb|3 + ( 0.25 * (3+2) * 0.33 * 7 ) = 5.9 gold| \\            % 3 + 2.8875
\verb|5 + 4 * ( 0.25 * (3+2) * 0.33 * 7 ) = 16.55 gold| \\      % 5 + 4 * 2.8875

\noindent Permanent magical items are much more expensive.

\section*{Exceptional and Legendary}
%-----------------------------------
The very rare legendary sword smiths and weapon wrights can make weapons of exceptional quality and properties, at exuberant prices, hundreds of gold. While a master craftsman can imbue a significant abs bonus and perhaps +1 modifiers, the legendary makers can build weapons with double abs and mod+2 and or dam+2. Some can even remove a slow-1 rating or add a fast+1, or modify parry and toparry stats, increase reach, etc.

All such weapons are custom made with damage and strength requirements suited for the person who orders the work. It takes some time to prepare weapons like these, probably months, and the work cannot be rushed.

Be sure that the manufacturing of artefacts like this will require many odd and rare materials and ingredients, which can be difficult to come by, and might require some adventuring...

The total cost including work, materials, and ingredients will come to at least 30x the list value of the weapon plus a minimum of 10 gold base line cost. This can be reduced to 15-20x by adventuring to procure some of the stuff instead of forcing the craftsman to buy it, if it can even be found in the market or region.


\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{magical}
\section*{Magical}
%-----------------
Permanently magical items are always custom made, and very exotic equipment.
First of all the item to be enchanted needs to have enough magical capacity to withstand the forces of the magic to be embedded within it. This means exceptional workmanship and the highest quality materials, often exotic minerals, woods, and stones go into the making of the item itself.

This could mean small side adventures, hundreds or thousands of gold, special conditions, etc.

\section*{Hirelings and Henchmen}
%--------------------------------
Hiring people to help slay monsters or guard the escape route is somewhat expensive, both in gold and experience share. Hired swords usually request somewhere around 1gold per 100xp up front for a regular cave hack adventure, and then half share of the loot. Longer or more dangerous adventures will cost more to hire people for, and simple safe duties will be cheaper. Some regions have higher salary standard than others as well. A poor village might have people at a quarter to half rate, while a rich town might cost double or more.

It is also possible to hire people on speculation, where they get full share of the loot but no up front payment, or on fixed pay where they get no part of the loot, but much higher up front salary.

Hirelings also get a full share of the XP for the adventure. This is sure to keep the players from hiring hordes of archers or double lines of soldiers to toss at the critters they meet.

Hired swordsman / archer, 150xp        15s for a few days' work, half loot share
