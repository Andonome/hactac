TODO: change mana recovery ?  Or have as alternate mana recovery



200218 - snipp - from rules.tex, 
                 
                 keeping the original \subsection*{Regaining mana} in rules.tex
                 
                 

\subsection*{Regaining mana}
%---------------------------
All mana is regained when the caster has rested fully from a good night's sleep. Some dungeons allow for casters to regain some mana when resting fully a number of turns, or when spending time at a certain location.
Wise wizards and skilled sorcerers alike sometimes carry mana restoring potions, crystal ball batteries, power staffs, etc, when they go hunting for gold and glory.

\

\noindent OR --- \todo regain continuous ?

\

\noindent Mana is recovered over time based on location and psy. Normal locations have a flow of raw magic that feeds mana at 1/h. Some places 1m/10r, some drain mana?
Perhaps some sort of meditation to regain mana faster ?

\

\noindent OR --- \todo summon mana ?

\

\noindent Mana is recovered through summoning actions, e.g: roll psy per round summoning to see if mana is gained? And have the location have a modifier to the psy? Or better, make orthogonal to psy, use mana/3 as base regain chance, fail on 10? That way the time to regain full mana is somewhat constant at 30r. Have environment modify chance or time per roll, or gain per success (fractional) ?
Summon is full round action, no movement. Perhaps require heavy equipment, meaning the party needs to lug around something heavy \emph{if} they want to be able to regain mana when in the dungeon...
