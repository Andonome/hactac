! seriously out of date !


note 210219:
if running session xp, e.g. 3-5xp/session regardless, and 4 heroes, then a standard 1 session battle should be around 12-20xp with minor extras for cool maneuvers. Longer fights or very high risk fights should have higher xp reward. But a regular one session fight should be based on the expected regular progression.

For humans a general idea is to reward 1xp per 20-30xp of the enemy:
3-5xp / 100xp of skills and matching weaponry.
