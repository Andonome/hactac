\chaptermark{hello}
\chapter*{hello}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{introduction}

The \emph{hactac} rules and world setting have evolved sporadically since early 2008. I was working on a post doc contract at Utrecht University and wanted to stay in contact with friends Up North in Gothenburg for some occasional gaming. Due to family and work requirements for most of us it was also evident from earlier on that we needed a new arrangement to keep gaming at a reasonable frequency. The proper get together rpg games are tricky to schedule when people have kids and live spread out over different countries.

That's why I wrote this stuff, which together with maptool, jarnal, and mumble conferencing works quite well for playing quick, simple, fun adventures and campaigns. It is not meant to get even close to the real gather-together-and-eat-homebrew-guck role playing. Instead it's just fun sporadic gaming. I inject these adventures to fill the void found in between our long running role playing campaigns and the one shot board games sessions.
We play this for a couple of few hours every now and then after people have put their kids to sleep.

Back in the day we briefly had a Warhammer Quest "campaign" running. It was fun, but quickly deteriorated and died due to the horribly poor power balance for more experienced characters. GW is of course notoriously craptitudish at balance design. We also played some Descent, but that requires gathering for a full day, and I usually prefer to play campaigns instead of one shot adventures. \emph{There is a gap to fill!}

Many years ago, as an early teen, I experimented with writing a very simple rule set and world setting, to use for a "silly campaign" when we couldn't get all the people gathered for my \emph{real} rpg campaign, but still wanted to play. That turned out quite well. It was fun despite the extreme simplicity of both the rules and the world. That was an encouraging experience to draw from when I started working on this package.

\

I've split the rules into the very basic fundamentals, and the rest. The GM and players should choose which trade off between speed and complexity they want for their games. The basic stuff is very fast and straight forward, while the full set is more suitable for a script assisted virtual tabletop like maptool, etc.

Fast gaming is crucial since we only have a couple of hours each session. The battles must be tactically interesting and the role playing rewarding, albeit cliché. Coordination, timing, positioning, complementary skills and battle maneuvers are very important when fighting critters under this rule set. Just charging in for dps dice rally doesn't cut it. This brings the tactical depth. The role playing aspects are written for comedy. In the end it is supposed to be fun, cliché, and more than a bit silly most of the time.

\section*{note: versions}
%------------------------
This is my personal notes package, not draft quality material intended for release. There is still a lot of stuff which is in progress of being updated, with inconsistencies, notes, TODOs etc.
I'm updating this package whenever I have the time and inclination. Use a good diff tool to find what's changed, removed or added. Easiest is of course to go directly to the latex source, but a decent pdf diff tool is perhaps sufficient? If you don't have something lying around I've tested (late 2017) \url{https://draftable.com/compare} and find it ... \emph{acceptable} ... for a simple 2-way diff, though lacking block move support and such real world use thingies.


\section*{note: comments and contributions}
%------------------------------------------
Anything you want to change or add? Contact me! My handle is \emph{netjiro} on github and gmail. Or even better: go to github \url{https://github.com/netjiro/hactac} and check out the source. Make your changes and send me a pull request. Even small stuff like spelling, grammar, clarifications, etc are appreciated. If enough people have interest in it I will \emph{try} to dig out some time to improve the quality to something closer to an early draft for publishing review.


\section*{note: pronouns}
%------------------------
Now, in Swedish we have the newfangled "hen" which essentially indicates someone where the gender is irrelevant in the context. Since the closest I can find in English is s/he, which I don't like, I'll keep using "he, him, his". Just read it as whatever offends you the least.

And just to be unnecessarily clear on this. For me, \emph{personally}: in my mind a "dude" is also of irrelevant gender, and I generally refer to my fun female friends as "dudes"... But I don't do that for boring women ... so I guess I'm not that well reformed after all.
