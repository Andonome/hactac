\subsubsection*{Buy a childhood}
%----------------------------
A childhood is a package of basic skills at a bargain price. Just the thing a budding Hero needs to survive in the wide world out there. Highly recommended, but not compulsory.

The various childhood packages are listed below.
All values are assumed to be round down unless noted otherwise.


\subsubsection*{Buy a profession}
%--------------------------------

Some typical professions frequently found among the dead: Barbarian, Fighter, Warrior, Soldier, Knight, Paladin, Hunter, Rogue, Thief, Mage, Sorcerer, Warlock, Necromancer, Farmer, Fodder, Dead, etc.

You don't need to buy a profession for your new Hero. Who says you must conform to the corporate machinery of critter killing or beer brewing?

Your character can say he is of any imaginable profession, without having a diploma, license, or degree to prove it. Therefore it is not necessary to give too much thought to the selection of profession. It doesn't matter much in battle mode since the profession tag itself is unlikely to give significant bonuses or penalties when fighting, but might be interesting in the role playing and campaign parts of the game.

However, it is possible to have your character go through the proper classical training and background, and thus get some bonuses and penalties to various skills and maneuvers.

Some various professions and their pros and cons are listed below.













\subsection*{List of childhoods}
%-------------------------------

Everyone has grown up, but not everyone learned what they need to know when they were little brats. So, a childhood is optional.

All rolls and property values are rounded down for the childhood starter kits. E.g: dex/3 or d10/4

If the character already has a skill or mod from before, then take the highest of the previous and childhood, not additive.

%The skill "avoid" is free to lvl = dex/2 (round down). \\
%The skill "brawling" is free to lvl = dex/3 (round down). \\
%The skill "throw" is free to lvl = dex/3 (round down). \\
%The skill "find" is free to lvl = per/2 (round down). \\
%The skill "gossip" is free to lvl = cha/2 (round down). \\
%Some languages are generally free to a certain level: \\
%Common is free for humans and halflings to int+3 \\
%Common is free for other races to int-3 \\
%Other races have their respective mother tongue is free to int+3 \\
% \\
%Some maneuvers are free: \\
%maneuver yield: everyone has this ability from the start. \\
%maneuver off balance: everyone has one step off balance. \\

\subsection*{List of professions}

%\tiny\begin{verbatim}
\small\begin{verbatim}

Adventurer: cost -5xp (yep, you get 5xp extra for choosing this)
            No bonuses or penalties, just a blank slate. Anyone can go on an

            sneak mod-3, back stab mod-6, haggle mod-3
            10xp free to make trusted items (casting mod)
            Always sends 25% of all earnings back to the temple order.
            Killing the Heathens is not a sin. Will never harm a True Believer.

Priest    : cost 10xp
            a defensive priest has healing and defence spells mod+3,
            an offensive priest has offensive spells mod+3.
            The opposite offensive/defensive spells have mod-3.
            All other spells mod-1.
            Has totXP/100 (round down) chance (on D10, not \% D100) of
            receiving a 1D50 silver bonus from his temple between
            worthy missions.
            When receiving lump incomes above 50 silver he will send
            50\% of the excess back to the temple.
            Wants to convert people he meet to The One True Faith.

True Hero : cost 10xp
            starts with the "cockroach" ability plus one random ability.
            Hidden Destiny (GM discretion) that WILL come back to bite you!
            The GM should be nasty when writing the destiny, and should not
            reveal it until later in the game when the character has leveled
            up a bit. Things like Sacrifice Yourself to Save a Companion, or
            Must Save The Princess (despite horribly poor odds), or some such
            funny, difficult and idiotic thing. Once the destiny is revealed
            the character will only receive 50% of normal XP (rest is lost)
            until he has completed the destiny.
            Has a 1000-totXP / 100 roll of recuperating from complete and utter
            destruction in time for the next mission (not session) if he dies
            before he has fulfilled his Hidden Destiny. Random gear might have
            gotten lost though, and at least some of the money.
