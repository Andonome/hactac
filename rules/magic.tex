\section*{Magic skills}
%----------------------
All magic skills and spells must be learned from a teacher, book, or similar. They cannot be trained from nothing without guidance like normal skills. This includes the base skills \emph{magic} and \emph{spell caster}, as well as the support skills like \emph{power casting}, and all spells.

Teachers can be the village witch, a professor at the City Magic College, an ally in the party who happen to know that spell, or the enemy wizard you captured a few weeks ago and been torturing ever since (\emph{but would you trust him?}). When creating a new character with magic skills and spells it's assumed that he had access to some magic training when growing up, perhaps 1d3 spells.

Some magic items can be used without any magic skills, others require that the user has some knowledge of the \emph{magic} skill. To learn and cast spells it is necessary to have trained \emph{spell caster}, and that is least expensive directly when the character is created.


\begin{description}


\item[Skill scf 2.0: "magic":] The caster can not spend more mana on each spell casting than his level in magic. This also limits the amount of mana he can pump into an already active spell each round, or how much mana he can use to activate or power a magical item.

The magic skill is also used when trying to understand magical texts and foreign spells and devices, etc. Or when activating certain magical items. It also provides some protection against certain types of spells.

Note: Not all magical devices, gadgets, trinkets, and weapons require the magic skill to use. Some just require being drawn, calling an activation word, or other circumstance. Some gadgets will also draw mana from the user by themselves without the user needing the magic skill to infuse them with power, and some items are powered by themselves or other sources.


%"spellcaster":] "spell caster":]
\item[Skill cost special "spellcaster":] is required to be able to learn and cast spells. It is not required for the use of magical items nor to train the magic skill.

The xp cost to train spell caster varies depending on the total xp of the character, increasing as the character advances:\\
If trained at character creation it costs 20xp.\\
After that it costs 20 + (total xp / 10).\\
E.g: For a 123xp Hero it costs 33xp, and for a 358xp Hero it costs 56xp to train spell caster.


\item[Skill scf 1.0: "power casting":] is when the spellcaster pays extra mana power to increase his chances for the casting roll. The caster gains mod+1 for each mana spent. The caster can not spend more extra mana than his skill in power casting. This cannot be used to raise the final total chance of success above 9.

Mana spent for power casting is not counted to the maximum total limit set by the caster's magic skill level.


\item[Maneuver cost 10: "held spell":] delays the final touch of the spell so that the effect can appear on very short notice. Can with good effect be used together with anticipate to inject the effects of a prepared multi-round-casting spell at a precise point in the action sequence of a battle round. It costs 3ap to cast a held spell. Holding a spell is free in the first few rounds but costs 1 mana per every exceeded period of 1 + int/3 rounds.


\item[Maneuver cost 5 + scf 0.5: "indirected strike":] allows the casting of \emph{strike, chock, flash} spells without direct line of sight to the target. By taking a mod-3 or 1r extra casting time the wizard can set a target for the spell by an approximate location, such as a description from a spotter communicated in 1 action (3ap), guesstimated location from recently seeing the target move out of sight (int roll), and similar, GM discretion.
\\ \todo finish "indirect strike" with "pinpoint on map" issues, miss allowance distance = lvl squares.


\item[Skill scf 2.0: "blood magic":] The dark arts train the caster to perform heinous acts of ritual sacrifice. By bloodletting a victim the caster can convert hp to temporary mana. Blood magic mana points form an ephemeral temporary mana pool which is not added to the caster's mana. It cannot be stored and must be used within victim psy rounds or start to evaporate at 1 mana per round. The evaporation timer starts next round after the ritual has finished. Casting from the blood magic mana pool is mod-1.

The caster can't build a sacrificial mana pool larger than his lowest value of psy and magic, plus the lvl of blood magic. The caster can sacrifice more than one victim to build the mana pool by killing one victim after the other, or have henchmen help out. Each victim adds +1 to the evaporation timer, but it is the victim with the lowest psy that sets the base value for the evaporation timer after the last of the chained rituals finish. \emph{So make sure your goons don't bring you substandard victims.}

Roll for the blood magic skill at the end of the ritual. A failed sacrifice yields no mana. A success=0 converts bloodlet mana to the mana pool at 0.5, success+3 converts at 0.66, success+6 at 0.8, success+9 at 1.0.

Sacrificing other: The ritual requires direct access to the victim. The ritual takes 3r +1r/m, where the caster carves and slashes the victim to carefully bleed him and get 1m/3hp of damage inflicted. If this kills the target the ritual yields the victims psy/3 as bonus mana at time of death.
The caster can use medicine/3 as bonus to the roll, or a successful first aid as a +1 bonus.
Both caster and target must be in base contact and stationary during the ritual, and the caster can't move further than psy sq away from the victim before casting. The victim must be restrained, or willing, during the ritual.

Sacrificing self: The caster can take 1r to draw up to 1 + blood magic/3 mana by sacrificing hp for mana 1:1. Carving and slicing is not needed for self sacrifice. There are no range or movement limitations when sacrificing self.

The blood magic mana are never added to the caster's mana, or stored somewhere. It's ephemeral and temporarily bound to the body of the victim until used for spellcasting or it evaporates.

Henchmen helping out with the sacrifice rituals must train "bloody handy" for 10xp, but are limited by their own psy in how many mana points they can extract from the victim.


\item[Skill scf 3.0 "drainage ritual":] Similar to blood magic, but drains mana directly from the victim. The ritual takes 5r to start then the caster must pass psy vs psy against the victim each round to drain 1+success/3 mana.
Roll for drainage ritual skill at the end of the ritual. Fail and success conversions like blood magic. The mana pool has the same range, time, and usage limitations as blood magic mana pool.

\section*{Magic spells}
%----------------------
Magic spells cannot be trained from nothing without the user learning the spell from a master, scroll, grimoire, etc. Purchasing a spell text costs 1-10 gold depending on the rarity, strangeness, power of the spell, etc. GM discretion.
Spells can also be deduced from magical objects and other sources, with a lot of study and some modified magic rolls.

Consider the spells listed below to be suggestions only. Build individual spells to make the use of magic more varied and unreliable. Perhaps the Hero wants to purchase a Black Bolt spell, but the grey old master only teaches him the Thread of Dread Darkness which is very similar to the Black Bolt but with some minor changes in range, effect, etc.

Magic spells are generally slow to cast. A normal time spell takes 1-2r to cast, a slow spell can take 3r or longer. A fast spell takes a couple of actions or one round.

When casting a spell, each mana pumped into the spell, including casting cost, reduces the chance of success by one. I.e. a black bolt with two extra mana for damage and one for range will cost 4 mana to cast and carry a mod-4 to cast.

Spells that have range don't allow for short,long,vlong,extreme range modifications of any sort unless explicitly stated. E.g: a black bolt r10 will not reach a target 11sq away from caster, but a shock bolt r20 can reach 30sq at dam-3.


\begin{description}

\item[Skill scf x.x: \emph{spell}] Most spells have a default skill cost factor of 0.33. Some spells are cheaper, some more expensive. Some spells have minimum requirements on psy or int.

If the character does not meet the int requirements, then the cost of the spell is doubled for each missing int point: e.g: Wizard Woolhead has int 4 and wants to learn an int 7 spell. He is missing 3 int points, thus the spell costs $2^3=8$ times as much to learn. He then spends his xp on a simpler spell.

If the character does not meet the psy requirements he will have mod-1 per missing psy when casting the spell.

\end{description}

These spells should be seen as examples, different masters teach their students different variations, some better, some worse, some just different. It is likely that most wizards' spells will be different from each other.

Spells with more complexity or targets have higher int requirements, and spells with higher power or control influence has higher psy requirements.


\subsection*{Custom spells, player created spells}
%-------------------------------------------------
More fun is to let the player write new spells for his character, and you as GM put requirements on them. That way the spell casters become more unique, and it's more personal for the player. This could also be a way around the limitation that the spells have to be taught by someone. Perhaps the Hero can just figure it out by himself?

When the spells are new they are in flux. Prototypes. And they have to be tested under a wide range of conditions. The first few adventures and tens of usages of the spells in varied situations should give you as GM, the player, and the rest of the group a decent insight into the functions and aspects of the spell. During this period the details, stats, and requirements of the spell should be fluid and change over time, until you've found the sweet spot. Remember to consider how the spell might work if it's used by a different caster, or in combination with a different group, tactics, opposition, equipment, combat styles, etc.

\subsection*{Bolts, lances, missiles, strikes, sparks, etc}
%----------------------------------------------------------
Many offensive spells have similar general mechanics.

\begin{description}

\item[bolt, zap, spark, lightning:]
Bolts don't take target \emph{to hit} modifications on the spell casting roll. They ignore things like target partial cover, shields partially in the way, target movement speed, partially obstructed view by fire, etc.
Generally these magic energies don't travel in a straight line from caster to target but might curve, form a branched lightning tree, split and reform, or snake forward erratically.

These spells are more powerful than the spear or strike categories and often require more time or mana to cast for similar effect.


\item[spear, lance, dart, arrow, quarrel, missile:]
These work similar to projectiles. The spells take target \emph{to hit} mods directly as casting mods. Target size, target movement speed, partial cover, shields in the way, shooting into melee, fire, etc all mod the spell casting roll directly. These are the same to-hit target mods as a firing arrows from a bow would take.

%TODO: think there are edge cases where this will not work right

Often the spell formation shoots in a rapid line to hit the target, or whatever gets in the way. A failed casting, which would have succeeded if not for the \emph{to hit} mods from cover, movement, target size, etc can be interpreted as a successfully cast spell which strikes cover or near the target instead.

%TODO: should this then still draw full mana, or reduced mana for minor fail? Can draw reduced mana and still make a nice flashy effect.

Since the spell behaves like a projectile, taking mods like a bow or crossbow, skills like sniper, lead target, etc work to alleviate those mods, just like for bows.


\item[strike, chock, flash:]
These are mental target lock spells that take casting mods based on target psy, actions, and magic training. Thus they tend to be less useful against other spellcasters. The casting roll takes the following mods, stacking, based on target:\\
mod -(target psy / 3)\\
mod -3 if target takes a 3ap action to resist the spell\\
mod -(target magic lvl / 3) (rd) E.g: magic 4 : mod-2
% mental lock spells ignore cover etc, but mods by psy etc
%              ignores target move mods, shooting into melee mods
%              BUT: they take cast mods for target psy, if target resists,
%                   and if the target knows magic skill.
%                   mod -(target psy / 3),
%                   mod -3 if target takes a 3ap action to resist
%                   mod -(target magic lvl)
%              Hence, almost useless against wizards


\item[blast, ball, cloud, storm:]
These are area effect spells. They can be targeted on characters, objects, or locations, and take no target mods.

fire storm     cast 1r 1m, dam 5 +2/m, range self, radius 1 +1/m,
               duration 3r +3/m, damage each round,
               caster is immune to fire for the duration
               The storm follows the caster at most up to walking speed,
               if the caster moves faster the storm will disappear.
               The max damage of the storm each round is reduced by one for
               each movement speed declared for the round.

               Hover by caster until target assigned,
               then seeks target until missed seeking or max lifetime.
               Seeking does not fail on roll of 10 as normal.
               They are smart enough to curve around objects and avoid obstacles
               unless they miss their seek roll (one per rnd). The target does
               not have to be in line of sight from the caster once assigned.
               Seeking penalty only after target assignment, not total time
               since summon.
               Assigning one or more bolts to one target is a
               very fast action (1ap).

               attack. The damage absorption costs mana, which is paid per
               attack, and not on casting. Each int/3 damage costs 1 mana.

               The caster can cancel the shield at any time ignoring initiative.
               Cancelling the shield is a 0a instant interrupt action.
               Anyone inside the shield can cast spells and attack as usual.
               All actions are mod-1 when inside the shield. Movement costs

               If the item is unseen (e.g: in a container) than it is a random
               item from among the potential items.
               A held item can be stolen with a successful psy-6 vs psy +1/m
               roll.

               The effect vanishes if the targets get outside the range of the
               spell, which is centred on the caster for the duration.
               A target looses the effect if he does not attack in a round
               when he has the opportunity to do so, unless attacking is clearly
               detrimental to his goal.

               Contact with other targets is only necessary for activation,

               A caster can keep int teleportation sites in memory.
               Memorising a site takes 10-per rounds (minimum 1r) and then
               placing a teleport marker on the site.

               Materialisation conflicts are resolved in some interesting way.
               A teleport marker costs ~1g and weighs 0.5enc.
               It is also possible to teleport unwilling targets, but it
               requires a psy vs 3psy +1/3m roll and takes 2r instead of 1.

               "intelligence".
               It can react to triggering conditions within its range, and can

               creature within range 10 regardless where it is aimed
               (except user). Outside range 10 it gives a mod+1 to hitting the
               selected target. Largest is decided by base size, or str.
               Fuck-off Fred swears it seems to like friendly fire.

Slight hammer  dam 5, abs 14, str 5, finesse-2
of solitude    After a regular hit the user can choose to spend 1 mana to:
               roll psy+str vs opponent str. Effect = diff/3
               For every effect point the opponent is dealt 1 damage
               penetrating and knocked back 1 square.

Mostly         dam 7(12), abs 15, str 7, finesse-2
Magical        On each hit, roll for 3 on a d10, if successful the MMM activates
Morningstar    and forcibly draws 1 mana from the user,
(heavy)        same rules for unconsciousness as "casting when dry".
               Activation adds 5 extra to max damage of the weapon (12) for the
               strike that just hit.
               All damage is treated as both physical and magical damage for

Terribly       A magical torch with a perpetual soft bioluminescence (range 8).
Tasty          It grows magical glowing mushrooms from the top.
Torch          They are very tasty. Any monsters nearby (distance 3) must
               succeed a psy roll or get the torch and eat the top mushrooms.
               They grow back in a day, but the torch is dark without them.
               Eating the mushrooms will cause "frenzy" (see spell)
               for 5+1d10 rounds.
               They cost a lot, difficult to find, and illegal in most areas.

The DMT of     The last person who found out what DMT stood for died in the
Dread and      process. It is a box of tools, and it gives off a soft "ping"
Utility        at regular intervals. A hammer is missing.

               and +3 to McGyverism, find, dungeoneering rolls

The Shiny      The helmet really shines. Provides a 20 distance bright light.
Helmet         It will draw one mana at the start of every 30 rounds.
               It's a scary 5 object against monsters that dwell in darkness.

The One Ring   There is only this one!

Banors Gate    A large orb set in a stretcher-like carrying contraption.
               It requires a total of 15 str to carry around.
               Up to four people can help carry the device.
               The Orb is magically linked to a secondary portal plate.
               Touching the orb activates a teleport to the plate.
               Stepping on the plate activates a teleport to the orb.
               The plate cannot be moved once linked with the orb. That would
               break the link, and the orb must be placed on the plate to
               create a new binding link.
               The orb is charged with a certain numbers of teleport activations
               when it is bound to the plate. Re-charging requires re-binding.
               Teleporting from the orb requires contact with it for five

Metaphysical   A harness with a faintly glowing red tendril sticking out of its
cord of        back, extending about a meter, dissolving into nothing.
Wunjee         Activating the harness takes one round and the wearer is flung
               through meta-space to a anchoring point, taking 1d4 damage
               penetrating. The harness is then physically bound to the
               anchoring point by a thick solid tether 3sq long,
               with abs15 and hp10.
               Climbing out of the harness takes 3r.
               Most are single use, but can be recharged at lower cost than
               a new item.

Metaphysical   A device with chains, hooks, locks, spikes and other interesting
anchor of      protrusions. It must be fastened to something very sturdy.
Wunjee         A red glowing tendril extends for about a meter, dissolving into
               nothing. Fastening the anchor takes 20r, unclasping takes 10r.
               It had better be really securely fastened.
               Most are single use, but can be recharged at lower cost than
               a new item.

Time Fly       A small crystal with a strange looking bug encased.
               Crush the crystal and the bug will turn back time for the user
               by one action. The user may then choose to do something
               else than he tried last time. Perhaps run away?
               The user acts first for the redo action, ignoring initiative.
               Crushing the bug is a 0ap interrupt action ignoring initiative.
               This assumes the bug is in a quickdraw slot, otherwise it must
               already be held or it is useless.
               Time Flies are very exotic and expensive items.
               Ad: A monster charges and attacks. You valiantly defend,
               but get slaughtered! No problem, just Bash the Bug!
               And you are right back at the monster just charging you.
               This time you run away, seeing that you can ignore initiative!
               The (movement +) attack-defend exchange or (movement +)
               attack(miss) - counter attack is considered to take
               place in one action time as long as the bug-crusher has taken
               no further actions.

               vary between different versions and manufacturers.

PortaPortal    Two large metal discs, comes as matched pairs. When both are
               placed on the ground and both seals are broken it creates a
               short lived portal between the disks. The portal usually lasts
               for about 10r. A disk must not be moved once the seal has
               been broken and that end of the portal activated.
               Often used to bring in a party to areas which is otherwise
               difficult to get in to, such as a well guarded keep, a remote
               mountain cave, or the inner treasure chamber of the dragon's
               lair. Just have your stealthling sneak in one of the discs of the
               portaportal, then activate. Meanwhile the rest of the party are
               safe and sound back in the tavern with the other end already
               active. Can also be very good for escaping a tight spot. Just
               make sure the monsters don't follow you through.
               Usually activates in 1-3r depending on quality.
               Single use only.

Proportional   The proportional plate mail absorbs 1/3rd of the incoming damage
Plate Mail     (round to nearest). Thus for heavy opponents it can
               be a real life saver, while for smaller critters it is nearly
               useless.

TurBoots       Magical stuffed fish slippers. Spend a mana and increase your
               movement: m+1 w+2 r+4 d+8. Must roll dex at end of movement
               or fall. Take mod+3 to the roll if going off balance. Or just do

\section*{Custom magical items}
%------------------------------
Sooner or later the powerful or rich Heroes will start fiddling towards making or buying custom magical items, weapons, armour. Probably permanent magical. This should be insanely expensive. For example, a sword with a permanent black bolt, even if it takes 3r to fire and draws mana from the user, is worth in total at least 100-200xp if you add up what that character would have to spend to learn spell caster, magic, black bolt. E.g: assume he's 400xp, spell caster is 60xp, magic 3 is 18xp, black bolt 9 is 24xp, assume determined and intelligent both to 3 is needed for another 18 + 18xp, trusty armour perhaps 2*5xp, and trusty sword and shield 5+5xp, for a total of 158xp.

Assume a baseline approximate money vs xp reward guideline is around 1s/xp, that means a baseline cost of the sword would be 15g. But then the sword can just be handed between characters, meaning it has a huge mana pool, and much higher usability than if just one character trained the skills.

Nope, it really has to be \emph{very} expensive.

Encourage the players to go for it though, and create fun side quests for them to hunt down the required materials and component, as well as travel to the right wizard, and convince the guy to take the time to build it for them. Perhaps he wants a tit for tat. Perhaps a fun ethical dilemma? And so on.

But don't make it easy for them to overflow their inventory with specialised custom magic stuff. It will be more powerful and versatile than originally thought.

\section*{Magical familiars and companions}
%------------------------------------------
Familiars and other magical companions are more intelligent than trained animals and often share a mind link with the owner.

\todo continue magical familiars ...


\subsection*{Treat your summoned critters well}
%----------------------------------------------
They are not all stupid. They might learn, word might spread, they can just say no and go home, or perhaps attack the summoner? Why do they follow command? How do you command them? Bribe, sound, food, smell, magic, what? How well does it work? How detailed are the commands? Or do you have direct control, but then you might need to possess the critter directly, leaving your body? Or, or, or.

Don't have \emph{all} summoned stuff be just disposable cannon fodder with unlimited precision of control and obedience.

\todo continue how command / control works and limitations

Fun if the summoned demon simply says nope. \textit{Last time you summoned me I got shot at. And I remember you summoned both Leeloo and Guupta and they never returned... I don't trust you any more!}

Perhaps summoning demons or critters require that the summoner first go find the critter and agree on a compact / contract for summoning, response time, payment.

Perhaps it is actually just forcing into being a trans-planar demon to materialise in the world and through sheer will partially possess or magically command it to execute a limited set of action types. Then it will dematerialise.
