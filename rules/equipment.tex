\section*{Weapons and armour}

Weapon damage stats are supposed to be read as 1dX. E.g: the sword does 1d6 damage not always 6. Weapon penetration is however always the max value and is not rolled. E.g: dam 5 pen 2 always does 1D5 damage but ignores up to 2 armour absorption.

The weapons listed below are the common weapon types and sizes. Custom made weapons are treated further down.

%TODO: explain the weapon stats:
%dam
%abs
%reach
%finesse
%mod,attack,defend,parry,todefend,toparry,toavoid
%str, str bonus cap
%maneuvers, poke, swing, etc
%stamina free attacks

% finesse is the limit of how extra difficult the attacks can be made for the target to defend agaist, using the fancy attacks skill or tricky attack maneuvers. E.g: Fancy Fred has fancy attacks 5 but swinging an axe which has finesse-3 and toparry-1 toavoid+1. FF cannot make the attacks more difficult than toparry-4 and toavoid-2, since the weapon finesse is the limiting factor. With a proper sword the FF could use his whole fancy attacks 5 giving his attacks a todefend-5 difficulty.

% typical: relative base, 1h/2h  dam , extras
% sword    +2   +2/+4                             finesse 6
% axe      +3   +3/+6                             parry-3 toparry-1 toavoid+1
% spear    +1   +1/+2 pen 0/1 parry -1/+1         reach
% staff    -1   -1/+1 parry +1/+2                 fast, reach

Staffs and Spears
spear slash maneuver costs 5xp and does slashing instead of piercing damage, 
but with dam-1 modifier.

Spears, pikes and halberds with enough reach can be used to attack over 
the shoulder or shield of a friend in a two layer formation. This requires 
phalanx of both characters. A three layer formation is possible if the 
first front line is kneeling or formed of shorter characters.

\subsection*{Ranged weapons}

Are the monsters a little too far away for your sword? Are you just a bit too lazy to walk up and say hi with your huge axe, or perhaps a tad shy? Then why not send a friendly murder greeting with a crossbow or throw them a heart felt javelin?

\

Thrown weapons include anything from knives and javelins to improvised missiles like beer bottles, rocks, and mistuned musical instruments.

Thrown weapons can also be used as poor versions of similar melee weapons in a pinch and with some mods. Regular melee weapons can often also be used as thrown weapons but often with mod-3 to mod-6 and 33\% to 66\% of the normal damage. When a thrown weapon is used as a temporary melee weapon it uses the melee weapon class skill, and when a melee weapon is used as a thrown weapon it uses the throw skill.

\small \begin{verbatim}
Throwing an already held weapon is a regular 3ap action. Drawing and throwing 
in one go is a 1r action. Faster throwing gives mods which can be mitigated by 
quick shot. Manually drawing with quickdraw then throwing as already held might 
be faster if the user is skilled in quickdraw.

Draw and throw:
normal  1r  mod=0
aimed   2r  mod+1
quick   6ap mod-3

Bows, crossbows, and ballistas all use arrows or bolts as ammunition. All rate of fire info below assumes that arrows are available from a readied easy to reach quiver, stuck in the ground, or similar.

If you choose the optional rule that characters need to keep track of their ammunution instead of just assuming "enough arrows" it might be worth investing some xp in arrow recovery.

Bows and crossbows have one less damage reduction on long ranges: Long dam-0, vlong dam-1, extreme dam-2.

rapid fire for bows:
Quick fire is 1r/9ap at mod-3. For every ap reduced below quick fire the
archer takes another mod-1. E.g: rapid fire bow at 4ap thus takes mod-8. 
Since quick is mod-3 and another mod-5 to reduce 9ap to 4ap.
An archer cannot bring the rapid fire ap cost below 3ap, mod-9.
Rapid fire from bows include reload from accessible quiver, arrows stuck 
in the ground, or similar.

\subsection*{custom weapons}
%---------------------------
It's always possible to have a craftsman build customised weapons that are suited specifically to the user's strength, dexterity, abs requirements, etc. These weapons cost a lot more, usually several times the normal list price, and require a skilled craftsman and sometimes some special materials.

The general guidelines for weapon classes look something like this:\\
\small \begin{verbatim}
1h blade:
    dam str+2, abs 2*dam-2
2h blade:
    dam str+4, abs 2*dam-2
fast blade:
    (3ap:) dam str+1, abs dam+0
    (2ap:) fast+1 if str>=dam+0 dex>=dam+2

1h axe:
    dam str+3, abs dam+1
2h axe:
    dam str+5, abs dam

staff (1h/2h):
    dam str-1/str+1, abs 2h dam+2
spear (1h/2h):
    dam str+0/str+1 and pen 1/2, abs 2h dam

club (1h/2h):
    dam str+0/+2, abs 2*str+2, knockback 1 str-vs-str
\end{verbatim} \normalsize








\subsection*{monster weapons}
%----------------------------
Some races, as NPCs, will sometimes use special versions of weapons which are different than those human craftsmen produce.

Orcs produce simple and heavy weapons. They have higher abs, lower finesse, higher str requirements. The market price is -50\% of human made weapons and their encumbrance is +33\%. When taking damage to abs they loose double abs.
\small \begin{verbatim}
orc war axe         dam 9, abs 12, parry-3, toparry-1, toavoid+1, finesse-2
1h                  str 7 (max +6 str bonus)

orc war spear       dam 7/8, pen 1/2, abs 10, parry-1/+1, reach 1 mod-3
1h/2h               str 7 (max +3 str damage bonus, max+3 penetrating bonus)
                    finesse-3/-5

orc war shield      abs 14, parry+3,
                    str 7, or slow-1 str 4
                    Ranged attacks mod-2 when in the way.
                    Hiding behind it (3ap) ranged mod-5
                    tackle mod+3
\end{verbatim} \normalsize
\pagebreak[1]

Elves produce slender weapons of very high quality. They will last longer and when rolling for weapon breakage they have half the chance of breaking (round down) and their permanent abs damage should be rounded down instead of rounded up. Elven made weapons are very rare and difficult to find outside of elven cities. Their encumbrance is -30\% of the human version, and the price is at least 10x higher than a human made. Start at 5+1d5g + 10x base price.

The elven illspets is used as a fast light defensive weapon which can also be used to attack heavily armoured targets.
\small \begin{verbatim}

\section*{Traps}

Traps are usually the kind of things that you fall into, put spikes into your belly, poke your eyes out, or that prick your finger injecting horribly painful poison. But they can also be your friends. If you have the time and money a few well placed traps can slow down or decimate your enemies as they advance to kill you dead.

All traps have a few different properties such as price and encumbrance when you buy and transport them. Then size, trigger type, damage, time to set up and arm, difficulty to hide, etc. Some traps require that you dig a hole, or hack out some empty space in a wall.

\small \begin{verbatim}

small snare: cost 5c, enc 0.5, size 1sq 50\% chance of triggering.
    Caught target can break free in one action on str vs 5 roll
    or disentangle in two rounds after successful int vs 2 roll
    or loop cut in one round if carrying small blade or similar.
    Takes 3r to set and must be anchored to something within 5sq.
    They are easy to hide at mod+3.

large snare: cost 1s, enc 1.0, size 1sq 100\% chance of triggering.
    Caught target can break free in one action on str vs 8 roll
    or disentangle in two rounds after successful int vs 2 roll
    or loop cut in one round if carrying small blade or similar.
    Takes 5r to set and must be anchored to something within 8sq.
    They are easy to hide at mod+3.

The common way to anchor snares is around tree trunks or other protruding solid
objects. Other ways is to use dirt wedges to anchor it in the ground. A dirt
wedge can be hammered down using heavy blunt object in 2r and can be retrieved
in 1d5 rounds using similar objects. They have a chance of 3+str to hold when
loaded. Dirt wedges cost 1s and weigh 0.5enc.
Snares can also be anchored in some stone walls using rock wedges. A rock wedge
can be inserted in a crevice using a hammer, butt of an axe, stone, or similar,
in 2r. It can be retrieved using similar tools in 1d5r. They have a chance of
5+(best of int or per) to hold when loaded. Rock wedges cost 5c and weigh
0.25enc.

\end{verbatim} \pagebreak[1] \begin{verbatim}
spike arm:
        Pre-made: cost 5s in materials, enc 5+1/dam.
        Half foraged: cost 3s in materials, enc 3 + 1/2dam + foraging.
        Completely foraged: cost nothing but requires a knife. not portable.
        Spike arm traps are the things that usually put a slab of pointy objects
        into the stomach of people. Excellent to rig just behind a corner or a
        tree, or perhaps directly in the ground covered by old leaves or snow.
        A skilled woodsman can forage for all the materials, but that takes 100r
        per dam extra. A smart man brings some stuff with him, and forages only
        for the scaffold and such, which takes 5r/dam. When in dungeons etc it
        might be a good idea to bring all of the materials in a bundle.
        A pre-made bundle is set in 10+dam rounds.
        A half foraged trap is rigged in forage time + 15+2*dam rounds.
        A completely foraged trap is constructed in forage time + 20+4*dam time.
        Hiding a spike arm trap is mod-0.

pit trap: cost nothing, requires perhaps a canvas, and some shovels to dig with.
        Pit traps are a cheap and common trap for when you have enough time.
        1) Dig a pit. In dirt outdoors this takes 100r/sq if the digger has
        a spade or shovel. Otherwise it takes four times as long. As many
        people can help as there are connecting side squares of the trap.
        2) Put down spikes or other nastiness, takes a few rounds per sq.
        3) Cover with suitably weak material, another few rounds per sq.
        4) Camouflage the trap, another couple of rounds per sq.
        A regular pit does 3 dam, a double deep pit does 6 dam, a triple deep
        pit does 10 dam. With spikes the damage is double, and the spikes get
        one point of penetrating per depth of the pit, including the first.
        Deep pits take longer to dig of course.
        Hiding a pit trap is mod+3.

\section*{Trained animals}

Companion animals can be trained to do simple tasks. Each animal has a set of specific commands it knows and can perform. Animals also have a command modifier, depending on how well they are trained, which affect how easy it is to command them. The skill "animal command" is used to handle animals.
The GM has ultimate control over the details of the animal's actions, but it will follow the given command as it interprets it, and according to situation. The practical movement on the map, rolls, etc is generally handled by the commanding player.

Some smarter trained animals can have skills and xp.
It can for example be useful for an archer to train their attack hawk or war dog as a "target pointer".

A very rare and exotic snake, about 1-2m long. It is green and oozes slightly of a glowing greenish aura (light source range 2). It rests on a staff or other long stick. For each consecutive two full rounds the snake is coiled around a target the target heals 1hp. The target cannot take any actions, and not move faster than maneuver. The owner of the snake may move at walk speed and take minor actions that do not require much movement. \\
hp 5, to hit-3 (incl movement), movement slither 4. \\
Command: engage \\
The snake will slither onto the indicated target and coil around its abdomen.
Command: disengage \\
The snake will uncoil from the target and return to its resting place


\eqitem{Glow Fly:}
Various small critters that glow in the dark. They don't give off much light, but it can be enough to scout some areas, especially for Heroes with dusk vision or night vision. The glow bugs are very small, hp 1, mod-6 to hit them with melee weapons, and mod-9 with ranged weapons. Various bugs have different speeds, from crawl 1 to fly 10. They are impossible to train, and have to be commanded by use of special food pastes. The owner throws a dollop of paste at a location or target and the bug goes there to eat. It will stay for a few rounds depending on the size of the dollop. Roll for animal command, and apply the fail diff as random +/- rounds to the intended time. After it has finished eating it will return to the owner if he is within 10-30 sq, depending on how keen eyes, ears, or nose the bug has. \\
It is recommended to have the gob dispenser as quick draw, then the "command" of throwing a dollop takes two actions, one for select size and one for throw. Otherwise it takes two rounds. Hitting the intended area with a dollop is a throw roll mod+3. Hitting an intended target is a regular throw roll. Dollop base range is dex+str, but minimum 3sq.


\eqitem{Jumping Spider:}
Aggressive spiders that can barely be trained. Unless directly controlled by animal command the spiders will always attack the nearest living non-spider it can find. This includes allies. They jump onto the target then stays attached,
making one "bite" attack each round until called off or the target dies.
\goodbreak \small \begin{verbatim}
jumping spider: hp 1, move 6, jump 2, all terrain (no water)
                Tiny target: melee mod-3 ranged mod-6
jump-attach attack 7 (once per round)
        The jump attack (2sq) does not count against movement.
        The spider stays attached until cleaned off or target dies.
        Each attached spider gives the target mod-1 to all actions.
bite 8 (mod-1 per abs) (once per round, after attached)
        dam 1 penetrating
command: attack (point and whistle, 3ap) max range 6
        The spider will attack the target until it's dead.
        Then it will move to attack the closest living non-spider
        it can find, including allies.
command: return (whistle, 3ap) max range 15
        Spiders will disengage and return to handler.
It takes an action (3ap) and a dex roll to clean off a spider.
The spider is placed on an adjacent square chosen by the target.
Others have dex+3 when helping the target.
Attacking a spider which is attached to a target require success+3
otherwise rest of the damage hits the target. Fail-3 or worse will
hit the target.
\end{verbatim} \normalsize
Spiders can be housed in a "spider box", or "hive box". A box normally holds max ca 3 spiders per enc. E.g: spider box enc 4 has "ammo" 10+1d4 spiders. A spider box can normally spawn a spider each round.

\section*{Companions}

The GM has ultimate control over the details of the companion's actions, but it will follow the given command as interpreted according to situation. The practical movement on the map, rolls, etc is generally handled by the commanding player. The character that handles companions need the companion command skill.

In general, most companions will take or require their fair part of XP and loot.

\eqitem{Henchman:}
A henchman can be anything from a goblin to an elf, he can be rented for the day or a trusted old friend. Henchmen have a mind of their own and full stats and skills according to a regular character sheet.
Hiring henchmen is expensive. They generally require both a payment up front and a cut of the treasure. Of course, if he cannot count... But most henchmen can both count and haggle. Annoying, isn't it.

The most expensive part though is that the henchman will also take part of the XP from the adventuring.


\eqitem{Demons, spirits, etc:}
Some heroes can summon strange beings to do their bidding. Some of these odd critters can stay around for a long time, and they might even be difficult to get rid of. Some will require some sort of payment or compensation, be it in gold, blood, xp, special equipment items, or left ears of the righteous.

For calculating division of plunder when one or both of the parties fail their counting rolls see the "counting" skill description. Some loot requires proper valuation. This is why henchmen often have some levels in the appraise skill.

Each henchman or companion critter have their own personality and goals. It may be nothing special, simple greed, or it may be something which has special meaning in the current adventure or campaign plot arc.

When playing henchmen, be stringent with actually letting them behave in a reasonable way. They don't have magical foresight, perfect sense of tactics, unlimited bravery, or other feats which would be required to act as the players often wish them to act. Henchmen require clear orders, and they will generally adhere to those orders as long as it makes sense and does not send them into unreasonable danger.

Situations often apply where the controlling player might want the henchman to take other actions than he has been ordered to because it is "clearly better". First, would it be better for the henchman? Is it evident for the henchman? Is he smart enough to figure it out (roll int)? Secondly, does the henchman often have enough free reign to ignore orders? Is he often strongly ordered to do dangerous stuff? Does he have the presence of mind to think clearly (roll psy)? And so on.

Most henchmen will try to save their own skin when they start to get hurt. They might disobey orders, hesitate when ordered to attack, be more defensive, etc.
