rewriting ranged weapons and skills, check parity against magic bolts
comparison against swordsman

swordsman:
Assuming opponents with skill 9 effective defense
swordsman will hit+damage ca 66% of attacks at fancy-6
                          ca 33%               fancy-3

comparative archer will hit+damage at 90% (fail on roll 10) since there is no effective defense against archer.


Shield effects: worse for swordsman since shield is so cheap to keep >12 which cancels fancy-3, but a large shield only blocks mod-3 if archer is shooting from +/- 45deg and nothing outside.
